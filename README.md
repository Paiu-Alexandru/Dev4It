# Dev4It Task
<p>This web application has the following functionalities:<p/>
<p>The project contains a two tabs menu.'Books' where the client can view the inserted books in a descending order, the books are paginated three per page.</p>
 <p>'Add new book' where the client can insert a new book.</p>
<p>Add new book is a basic User Interface (UI) that exposes a form where the user can input Book Name, Gendre, Number of pages, Free or Paid, Price in case it is not Free.</p>
<p>In the Gender section options are loaded dynamically.</p>
<p>In the price section I created three options to avoid the user accidentally inserting a book for free.</p>
<p>To download the project click CODE and select download ZIP. After unzipping you can run the local code of course if you already have the database installed</p>
